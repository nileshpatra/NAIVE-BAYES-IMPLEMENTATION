# NAIVE-BAYES-IMPLEMENTATION
NAIVE BAYES ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTED FROM SCRATCH AND COMPARED ACCURACY WITH GAUSSIANNB

THIS REPOSITORY IS A PYTHON - 3 IMPLEMENTATION OF NAIVE BAYES ALGORITHM APPLIED ON IRIS DATASET

1. IT USES A FIT FUNCTION TO TRAIN THE ALGORITHM
2. PREDICT FOR PREDICTING THE TEST/TRAIN DATA
3. COMPARED THE ACCURACY WITH GAUSSIAN NAIVE BAYES
4. THE ACCURACY OF OUR ALGORITHM TURNED OUT TO BE GRATER THAN THE ACCURACY OF GAUSSIAN NB IN SKLEARN
